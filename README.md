# PDFPowerExtractor

**Preserve visual form field relationships when converting PDFs to AI-readable text**

## üéØ The Problem

The issue isn't that PDF text extraction can't extract questions and answers - it can. The problem is that **questions and answers become disconnected** during extraction. 

When extracting text from a PDF form, traditional tools produce output where the spatial relationship is lost:

```
Page 1:
3.2 Employment Status
3.3 Years of Experience  
3.4 Education Level
...
[hundreds of lines later]
...
‚óè Full-time
‚òí 0-2 years
‚óã Bachelor's Degree
```

To human eyes viewing the PDF, it's obvious that "Full-time" answers question 3.2. But after text extraction, an AI model has no way to reconnect these scattered elements. The visual proximity that makes the relationship clear to humans is completely lost in the extracted text.

## üí° The Solution

PDFPowerExtractor uses visual AI processing to preserve form field relationships, making filled PDFs readable to AI models while minimizing costs through intelligent page routing.

- ‚úÖ Preserves checkbox states: ‚òí (checked) vs ‚òê (unchecked)
- ‚úÖ Maintains radio button selections: ‚óè (selected) vs ‚óã (unselected)  
- ‚úÖ Keeps Q&A relationships intact
- ‚úÖ 30-40% cheaper than pure AI processing

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PDFPowerExtractor.git
cd PDFPowerExtractor

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your OpenRouter API key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Extract a PDF
python pdfpower.py extract your-form.pdf
```

## üí∞ Costs

Average cost per 10-page document: **~$0.0014** (less than 0.2 cents)

| Pages | All Form Fields | Typical (36% text) |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 10    | $0.0023        | $0.0014          |
| 32    | $0.0072        | $0.0045          |
| 100   | $0.0225        | $0.0144          |

## üß™ Tested Models (August 2025)

### ‚úÖ Models with 100% Accuracy

| Model | Provider | Cost/M tokens | Context | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------------|---------|-------|
| **google/gemini-2.5-flash** | Google | $0.075/$0.30 | 1M+ | **RECOMMENDED** - Best value |
| anthropic/claude-3-haiku | Anthropic | $0.25/$1.25 | 200K | Reliable backup |

### ‚ùå Models That Failed

| Model | Issue | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| google/gemini-flash-1.5-8b | 50% checkbox accuracy | Version 1.5 insufficient |
| google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite | 50% checkbox accuracy | "Lite" variant insufficient |
| mistral/mistral-small-3.2 | 0% checkbox detection | Cannot see checkbox states |
| openai/gpt-4o-mini | 0% overall accuracy | Complete failure |
| mistral/pixtral-12b | Context too small | 32K < 37K needed per page |

**Critical**: Checkbox detection is the key differentiator. Most models fail here.

## üìã Technical Requirements

### Critical Context Window Discovery
- **Minimum: 64K tokens** per page
- Each page requires ~37,000 tokens regardless of DPI (100-300)
- Models with <64K context cannot process even a single page

### Processing Requirements
- **Must use 1-page chunks** - Multi-page chunks reduce accuracy
- **DPI: 100-150 optimal** - Higher DPI doesn't improve accuracy
- **Format: PNG, Black & White** - Best compression for form pages

### Why Not Traditional OCR?
We tested traditional OCR approaches:
- **Tesseract**: Cannot detect checkbox states reliably
- **PaddleOCR**: Works but takes 5+ minutes per page, unsuitable for production
- **Resource Requirements**: Would need expensive infrastructure

## üîß How It Works

1. **Page Analysis**: Analyzes each PDF page to detect form fields vs pure text
2. **Intelligent Routing**:
   - Pure text pages ‚Üí PyMuPDF extraction (free, instant)
   - Form field pages ‚Üí AI visual processing (preserves relationships)
3. **Smart Caching**: MD5 fingerprinting prevents unnecessary reprocessing
4. **Result Merging**: Combines all pages in order with processing method labels

## üìä Features

- **Hybrid Processing**: Automatically chooses optimal method per page
- **Form Preservation**: Maintains visual Q&A relationships
- **Cost Optimization**: ~37% savings through intelligent routing
- **MD5 Caching**: Only regenerates when PDF changes
- **Model Flexibility**: Easy to add new AI models
- **Detailed Reporting**: Shows costs, processing times, and methods

## üîë Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenRouter API key
- Dependencies: PyMuPDF, pdf2image, Pillow, requests
